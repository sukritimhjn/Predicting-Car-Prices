# Predicting-Car-Prices

The Project aims at predicting car's market price using the data-set at "https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/automobile".
It has 26 attributes, with information on various cars. For each car we have information about the technical aspects of the vehicle such as the motor's displacement, the weight of the car, the miles per gallon, how fast the car accelerates, and more. 

K-nearest Neighbors Regression algorithm was used to used to predict the prices, and analysis was drawn as how different features and hyperparameters affect our answer.
